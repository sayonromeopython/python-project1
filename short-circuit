Short-Circuiting in Python
Short-circuiting in programming occurs when the execution of a code/ program is becomes complete with going through the entire program or code. In other words, the result of a compound conditional expression is determined after evaluating the first conditional expression in a multiple conditional expression. 

Boolean operators and expressions are utilized to create a Short-circuiting program in python. 
The Boolean operators and and or are useful in creating short-circuiting program. 
Short-circuiting example with the and operator. 
Short-circuiting will not occurs with an and operator alone. 
The Boolean operator and can be use combined two or more conditional expressions are combined. The result of those combined expressions is true only when all expressions are true. 


Short-circuiting example with the or operator.
The Boolean or operator can be used to combined multiple conditional expressions. The result is true when one expression is true.

#Critical Thinking Assignment1
#A python program to add two numbers from the user inputs
num1 = float(input('Please enter the first number,ber:'))
num2 = float(input('Please enter the second number:'))
#adding the two numbers given by the user
added_nums = num1 + num2
print('Addition of the two numbers result:',added_nums)
#Subtraction of the two numbers ented by the user
subtraction1 = num1 -num2
subtraction2 = num2-num1
print(' Subtracting the second input from the first input will give you:', subtraction1)
print('subtracting the frist input from the second input will give you:', subtraction2)



# Part two of the assignment
# multiplying two number enter by a user
num1 = input('Please enter your first number:')
num2 = input('Please enter your second number:')
division_result1 = num1/num2
division_result2 = num2/num1
print('Division of the first entry by the second entury will give:', division_result1)
print('Division of second entry by the first entry will give:', division_result2)

#Multiplication 
#multiplying two number enter by the user
num1 = float(input('Please enter the first multiplier:'))
num2 = float(input('Please enter the second multiplier;'))
mult_result = num1 * num2
print('Multiplaction of entury one and entury two will give:', mult_result)
